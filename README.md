# CSI Proxy

CSI Proxy is a Go library providing convenience methods to execute privileged storage operations in Windows, such as formatting and mounting volumes.
A container, such as CSI node plugins, can import the CSI Proxy library to get a Go interface for storage-related Windows system calls.
Since the commands executed are privileged instructions, containers must run as [HostProcess containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/create-hostprocess-pod/).

Closely related functionalities are bundled as API groups that target specific areas of storage. The available API groups are

- Disk
- Filesystem
- SMB
- Volume
- iSCSI (experimental)
- System (experimental)

## Compatibility

Recommended K8s Version: 1.23

## Usage

See [usage.md](/docs/API.md) for detailed usage instructions, as well as a migration guide from v1.

## Community, Discussion, Contribution, and Support

Check out [development.md](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for instructions to set up a development environment to run CSI Proxy.
